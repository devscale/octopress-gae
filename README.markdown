[Octopress](http://octopress.org) is a blogging framework based on the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) engine. It provides a pretty semantic HTML5 template working both friendly for desktops and mobile devices, and generates posts and pages from source files in the [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language.

Octopress provides [three ways](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/) to deploy an Octopress blog: Github pages, Heroku, and Rsync. As all pages generated by Octopress are static HTML pages, we can actually host an Octopress blog by any web hosting services. With some tweaks and configurations, we can, of course, host an Octopress on Google App Engine.

Google App Engine supports to handle static files. However, unlike a traditional web hosting environment, Google App Engine does not serve static files directly unless [configured to do so](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/staticfiles.html). Thus, after creating an app to host an Octopress blog, we need to handle all requests to HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript code, and etc., in `app.yaml`.

To deploy an Octopress on Google App Engine, first [set up Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/). Then check out configuration file `app.yaml` from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/relarge/octopress-gae) and put it into the Octopress directory.

After writing [your first post](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/), run `rake generate` to generate HTML pages and `app.cfg update [Octopress directory]` to deploy generated pages to App Engine.
