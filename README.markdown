[Octopress](http://octopress.org) is a blogging framework based on the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) engine. It provides a pretty semantic HTML5 template working both friendly for desktops and mobile devices, and generates posts and pages from source files in the [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language.

Octopress provides [three ways](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/) to deploy an Octopress blog: Github pages, Heroku, and Rsync. As all pages generated by Octopress are static HTML pages, we can actually host an Octopress blog by any web hosting services. With some tweaks and configurations, we can, of course, host an Octopress on Google App Engine.

Google App Engine supports to handle static files. However, unlike a traditional web hosting environment, Google App Engine does not serve static files directly unless [configured to do so](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/staticfiles.html). Thus, after creating an app to host an Octopress blog, we need to handle all requests to HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript code, and *etc.*, in `app.yaml`.

To deploy an Octopress on Google App Engine, check out source code forked from the original Octopress source code from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/relarge/octopress-gae), and then replace "your application id" in `app.yaml` to the name of your app created in App Engine. Run `rake install` to set up the default Octopress theme, and [configure Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/). Then [write your first blog post](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/). After finishing your first post, run `rake generate` to generate HTML pages and `app.cfg update [your application directory]` to deploy generated pages to App Engine.

A demo blog can found at [`http://octoprs.appspot.com/`](http://octoprs.appspot.com/). If your find any bugs in this article, please submit an issue in [Github](https://github.com/relarge/octopress-gae).

## Contributing

We love to see people contributing to Octopress, whether it's a bug report, feature suggestion or a pull request. At the moment, we try to keep the core slick and lean, focusing on basic blogging needs, so some of your suggestions might not find their way into Octopress. For those ideas, we started a [list of 3rd party plug-ins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins), where you can link your own Octopress plug-in repositories. For the future, we're thinking about ways to easier add them them into our main releases.
